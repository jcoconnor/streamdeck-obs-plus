# StreamDeck OBS+

This plugin for the Elgato StreamDeck allows for better control of OBS when using Studio Mode.

It is based on the repo https://github.com/unknowndomain/streamdeck-obs-plus



The features are:
- A scene button with tally light for preview and program, that activated the scene in preview rather than in program as the in-built buttons do.

The scene button is customised for livestreaming use with PTZ Cameras - further documentation to follow.

NOTE: This plugin requires [obs-websocket](https://github.com/Palakis/obs-websocket) to work.
