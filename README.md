# StreamDeck OBS+

This plugin for the Elgato StreamDeck allows for better control of OBS when using Studio Mode.

The features are:
- A transition button button which can be assigned to perform any transition you have setup in OBS with a fixed time and without using hotkeys to accomplish this.
- A scene button with tally light for preview and program, that activated the scene in preview rather than in program as the in-built buttons do.
- A multiview button for opening a fullscreen multiviewer quickly

NOTE: This plugin requires [obs-websocket](https://github.com/Palakis/obs-websocket) to work.
