# Notes where we are

- keyNewSlideBaseScene - not quite there yes as we haven't quite cleared the old camera out of the way. So what do we want in workflow here.
  - Can now select and move to preview on other cameras - but I lose the live preview camera - or maybe I don't and we can just clear out of it. Yellow remains on the original live one though - maybe should clear that - or just leave it ?
  - A full clear preview should disarm slides full stop.
  - Also - a clean transition to live should be good too.
- Confusing when Cam 1 is new pre-slides preview but doesn't actually live to Camera two and switch over the slides for it.
